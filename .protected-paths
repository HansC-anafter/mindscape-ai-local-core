# Protected Paths Configuration
# ==============================
# Paths listed here are BLOCKED from being committed or pushed to this repo.
# Both pre-commit and pre-push hooks read this file.
#
# Format:
#   - Lines starting with # are comments
#   - Empty lines are ignored
#   - Each non-comment line is a directory prefix to block
#   - Lines starting with ! are whitelist exceptions

#   belongs ONLY in mindscape-ai-cloud. It must NEVER be pushed to local-core.
