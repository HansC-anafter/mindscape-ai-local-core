# 📝 Decision Workshop

> **Brand is not generated by a "unique prompt", but by a series of human decisions.**

## Goal

Guide brand to complete all key decision card approvals and establish brand decision history.

## Core Concept

The purpose of this workshop is not to "let AI make decisions", but to:

1. **Let brand see** which decisions they must make themselves
2. **Record decisions** for future traceability and explanation
3. **Align team** so everyone knows the brand's position
