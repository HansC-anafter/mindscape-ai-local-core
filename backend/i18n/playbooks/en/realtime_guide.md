# Real-time Brewing Guide

Get live coaching prompts while you brew.

## Overview

This playbook provides real-time guidance during your pour-over brewing session, helping you maintain consistent technique throughout.

## How It Works

1. **Connect Scale**: Link to your coffee scale
2. **Start Brewing**: Begin your pour
3. **Receive Prompts**: Get audio/visual cues when adjustments are needed
4. **Stay Focused**: Prompts are throttled to avoid overwhelm

## Prompt Throttling

The system uses intelligent throttling to provide helpful guidance without being annoying:

- Prompts only trigger after deviation persists 1.5+ seconds
- Maximum 2 prompts per segment
- Direction hints before specific numbers ("slow down" before "target 5 g/s")

## Coaching Modes

- **Quiet**: Voice-only, minimal prompts
- **Coach**: Balanced visual + audio feedback
- **Strict**: Detailed prompts with specific targets

## Best Practices

- Use headphones for audio cues
- Position screen where visible during pour
- Start with "Coach" mode, adjust based on preference

## Hardware Requirements

- Compatible BLE coffee scale (Decent Scale recommended)
- Or use mock mode for practice
