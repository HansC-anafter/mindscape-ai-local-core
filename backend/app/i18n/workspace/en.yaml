welcome:

    Welcome to "{workspace_title}" workspace!

    This is your collaboration space where I can help you:

    **I can help you:**
    • Execute Playbook workflows (e.g., daily planning, project breakdown)
    • Manage tasks and track progress
    • Answer questions and provide suggestions
    • Analyze your work patterns

    **Quick start:**
    • Tell me directly what you want to accomplish
    • Or click the suggestions below to get started

    **Suggestion:**
    If this is your first time, I recommend completing the "Mindscape" cold-start tasks so I can better understand your needs and work habits.

    Let me know what you need help with!
